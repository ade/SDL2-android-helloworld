# SDL2-android-helloworld
Skeleton for compiling an SDL2 app for android

If all goes well, you will compile an app that shows a SDL logo that exits the app when tapped.

# Requires 
* android SDK
* android NDK standalone version R9, or program will exit with an error code saying it is missing an "atof" function when run.
* ant
* java jdk
* android NDK, SDK in PATH (see build.sh)
* Source of SDL2 downloaded in libsdl/SDL folder (the whole zip file, I used SDL 2.0.3; https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.3.zip)
